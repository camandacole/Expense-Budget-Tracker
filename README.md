INTRODUCTION
I decided to give this application the name Pengett which is a monthly expense budget
tracker that enables the user to track their budget on a monthly basis. It starts tracking
the budget by the current month until a new month is reached. It allows entry of multiple
income sources for the current month and displays both the total income for the month
and how much expenses are spent so far. Users can also view a table of expenses and
a graph displaying the expenses spent over the month. Additionally, yearly expenses
can also be displayed. This app requires creating an account in order to have access
through login.
