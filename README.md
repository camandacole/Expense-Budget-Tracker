# INTRODUCTION

Pengett is a monthly expense budget tracker designed to help users manage their finances effectively. Upon creating an account and logging in, users can track their budget from the current month until a new month begins. The app allows for the entry of multiple income sources for the current month, displaying both the total income and the amount of expenses incurred so far. Users can view a detailed table of expenses and a graph that visualizes the distribution of expenses over the month. Additionally, Pengett provides a feature to display yearly expenses, giving users a comprehensive overview of their financial situation.
